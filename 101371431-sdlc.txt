Software development is an iterative process that is followed for a software project that consists of several phases for building and running software applications. SDLC helps with the measurement and improvement of a process, which allows an analysis of software development each step of the way.

How SDLC works
SDLC simply outlines each task that is required to create and deploy a software applicationâ€”this prevents the reduction of waste and increases efficiency along the way. Monitoring that is a part of SDLC helps companies ensure that everything is timely, budgets are adhered to, and the software continues to be a feasible investment. SDLC is often described as leveraging Agile or Waterfall approaches and many organizations use a hybrid of both.

1. Identify the Current Problems
ITSM is a strategic approach to IT management, with a focus on delivering value to customers. ITSM clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of every individual and department with regard to IT services. It allows for increased productivity, lower costs, and improved end-user satisfaction.

2. Planning
Leaders of the project evaluate the terms of the project, including the calculation of labor and material costs, to create a timetable with goals. Planning must also include areas of feedback from stakeholders or anybody who is going to benefit from the applications. The scope of the project should be clearly defined, the purpose of the application outlined, and the boundaries that are needed to keep the project from expanding beyond scope or shifting.
